# Weather-Data-Analysis-and-Preprocessing-for-Predictive-Modeling

The project analyzes historical weather data using machine learning and data visualization techniques. It processes a dataset (weatherHistory.csv) containing various weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The primary goal is to clean, analyze, and normalize this data to identify patterns and trends in weather conditions. The project also handles missing values and prepares the dataset for further analysis or predictive modeling.

To ensure data quality, the project fills missing values in categorical columns like "Precip Type" with the mode of the column. It then applies normalization techniques, such as Min-Max Scaling, to continuous variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility. This standardization ensures that the data is suitable for machine learning models and statistical analysis.

Visualization techniques using matplotlib and seaborn help explore relationships between different weather parameters. Graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps are used to gain insights into how weather conditions vary over time. These visualizations help in understanding trends and anomalies in the dataset.

By processing and analyzing historical weather data, this project provides valuable insights into climate patterns and variations. The cleaned and normalized dataset can be used for predictive modeling, such as forecasting future weather conditions or detecting anomalies. This work serves as a foundation for applications in climate research, agriculture, and disaster preparedness
